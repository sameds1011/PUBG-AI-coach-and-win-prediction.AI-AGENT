Project Overview

In this project, CrewAI technology was used to analyze real PUBG player data and provide players with personalized AI coaching recommendations. The system not only calculated winning probabilities, but also delivered data-driven and AI-powered insights to optimize playersâ€™ movement, combat strategies, and overall decision-making.

Technologies Used

Machine Learning (ML):

Random Forest algorithm was applied to analyze player data and predict winning probabilities.

Statistical modeling was used to evaluate metrics such as damage, headshot ratio, average movement time, and vehicle usage.

Large Language Models (LLM):

OpenAI GPT-4o integration enabled coaching, strategy suggestions, and personalized development tips.

The LLM interpreted outputs from ML models to provide human-like, context-aware recommendations.

User Interface: An interactive Streamlit-based dashboard was developed for an accessible user experience.

Data Visualization: Player performance trends and statistics were visualized using Plotly.

Security: Sensitive credentials such as API keys were securely managed using python-dotenv.

Key Features

Location Analysis: Recommended drop zones, high-density player areas, ambush points, and kill-gathering strategies.

Weapon & Equipment Suggestions: Optimal weapon loadouts tailored to player stats and gameplay style.

Movement & Vehicle Usage: Strategy recommendations based on average walking distance, vehicle usage rate, and time spent hiding.

Combat Strategies:

Close-range: Fast reflexes and aggressive tactics

Long-range: Positioning, sniper usage, and distance control

Performance Analytics: Damage dealt, headshot accuracy, win ratio, average movement time, and kill count.

Added Value

This system combines ML for statistical analysis with LLM for personalized coaching, offering players not only data-driven insights but also dynamic, adaptive, and personalized guidance that accelerates improvement and increases their chances of winning.
